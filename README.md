# Warchest

Warchest is a game of war that is played on a hexagonal grid. The game is played by two players, each of whom controls a set of units. The goal of the game is to control 6 points of control on the board. More information about the game can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuiViXGNfcw).
